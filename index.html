 <H1>INTRODUCTION TO ME</H1>
 <P>Hello..oups! Bonjour Everyone! My name is Jullia Alloux. I am a French girl who is currently studying Medicine. I
  have been mentally traumatized by reading the stuffs on my book. I am a single child, born on December 25, 2000. That
  makes a capricon!. That is my sun sign but it is also my rising sign. Putain!. Oups again, I am kinda clumsy
  sometimes. I slip on the road too many times, forget things on places. Maybe its because of my moon sign. Take a
  guess? you cant? then I am not going to tell you.Have I told you how much I like astrology? I am really passionate
  about it. I could talk about it for hours..</P>

 <p>I want to leave my hometown and go somewhere else like Tibet or south America. I wanted to be a monk once and also
  nearly came close to shaving my hair. There is one guy I met through twitter says that he really likes my hair but he
  doesn't matter. I don't want to talk about my feelings much because it makes me feel vulnerable. I don't like being
  vulnerable or do I? Maybe to a right person..I don't want to be called cute because it sounds like a baby animal in
  french. Tong and socks are my favourite attires and I like to eat tikka masala in an Indian restaurant. I have a
  birthmark on my cheek. I had a picture which showed my birthmark on instagram so I deleted it. Pfiou!!. I have been
  thinking about meaning of life a lot lately. Something is missing.
 </p>

 <p>I am funny and smart hahahah but I also contradict my own statement sometimes. I think it is OK to call me pretty.
  Shar pei's are pretty too. Infact, I used to look just like one when I was young. Do you want to see what I look
  like?hehe

 </p>

 <p>I like things which can touch my soul(this is an assumption). There is one song that I happen to really like:- <a
